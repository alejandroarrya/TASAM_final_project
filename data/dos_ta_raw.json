On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Travelers should be prepared for the possibility of travel restrictions with little or no advance notice. Most commercial air carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.<\/p>\n<p>Those currently in China should attempt to depart by commercial means. U.S. citizens remaining in China should follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities&#8217; guidance for prevention, signs and symptoms, and treatment. We strongly urge U.S. citizens remaining in China to stay home as much as possible and limit contact with others, including large gatherings. Consider stocking up on food and other supplies to limit movement outside the home.&nbsp;In the event that&#8239;the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the U.S.&nbsp; Embassy and Consulates&#8239;to provide assistance to U.S. nationals within China may be limited.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to contain the novel coronavirus, the Chinese authorities have suspended air, road, and rail travel in the area around Wuhan and placed restrictions on travel and other activities throughout the country. On January 23, 2020, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency U.S. personnel and their family members from Wuhan. On January 29, 2020, the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency personnel and family members of U.S. government employees from China.

Kidnappings by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited (to include accepting applications for U.S. passports and U.S. Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, as well as providing notarial services), and the U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.<\/p>\n<p>Long standing conflict with neighboring states and porous borders have contributed to a complex and unpredictable security environment. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.<\/p>\n<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.<\/p>\n<p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012 and as recently as early 2019. U.S. citizens are also targets of arbitrary abduction and detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.<\/p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and\/or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2018\/12\/10\/2018-26680\/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir\">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)<\/a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to U.S. civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.<\/p>\n<p>As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the Government of Syria&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants<\/li>\n<li>places of worship<\/li>\n<li>schools<\/li>\n<li>parks<\/li>\n<li>shopping malls and markets<\/li>\n<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites<\/li>\n<li>public transportation systems<\/li>\n<li>airports<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.<\/p>\n<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For further information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/travel.state.gov\/\">Department of State's travel website<\/a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/traveladvisories\/traveladvisories\/worldwide-caution.html\">Worldwide Caution<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/traveladvisories\/traveladvisories.html\">Travel Advisories<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/international-travel\/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html\">country information<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/travelgov\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/travelgov\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/travelgov\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) provides several resources to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. private sector abroad.

This instability often hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver critically needed food, medicine, and water. Critical levels of violence, to include armed conflict, artillery shelling, and air strikes, persist throughout the country. There are also reports of landmines throughout Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>Cholera is present throughout Yemen. There is a limited availability of medicine and medical supplies, and adequate medical treatment is unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>There is a very high risk of kidnapping, and detention of U.S. citizens in Yemen, particularly dual national Yemeni-Americans. Rebel groups in Sana&#8217;a have detained U.S. citizens, including dual Yemeni-American citizens. U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty &#8211; including lengthy delays &#8211; when attempting to depart Yemen.<\/p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Yemen, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and\/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR).

Kidnappings by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, the use of chemical warfare, shelling, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited (to include accepting applications for U.S. passports and U.S. Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, as well as providing notarial services), and the U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.<\/p>\n<p>Long standing conflict with neighboring states and porous borders have contributed to a complex and unpredictable security environment. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.<\/p>\n<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.<\/p>\n<p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012 and as recently as early 2019. U.S. citizens are also targets of arbitrary abduction and detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.<\/p>\n<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and\/or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2018\/12\/10\/2018-26680\/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir\">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)<\/a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to U.S. civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.<\/p>\n<p>As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the Government of Syria&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the&nbsp;FAA&#8217;s safety assessment page. For more information U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;the FAA&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.<\/p>\n<p>Read the Safety and Security section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/international-travel\/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages\/SyrianArabRepublic.html\">country information page<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to travel to Syria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit our website on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/passports\/en\/go\/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html\">Travel to High Risk Areas<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and\/or power of attorney.<\/li>\n<li>Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care\/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs, if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.

In those instances, U.S. embassies and consulates will make every effort to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.<\/p>\n<p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants<\/li>\n<li>places of worship<\/li>\n<li>schools<\/li>\n<li>parks<\/li>\n<li>shopping malls and markets<\/li>\n<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites<\/li>\n<li>public transportation systems<\/li>\n<li>airports<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.<\/p>\n<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For further information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/travel.state.gov\/\">Department of State's travel website<\/a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/traveladvisories\/traveladvisories\/worldwide-caution.html\">Worldwide Caution<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/traveladvisories\/traveladvisories.html\">Travel Advisories<\/a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/international-travel\/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html\">country information<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/travelgov\">Twitter<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/travelgov\">Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/travelgov\/\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>The Department of State's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) provides several resources to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. private sector abroad.

Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans--including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics--on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security.

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Iran is experiencing sustained community spread&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/novel-coronavirus-2019.html\">of COVID-19.<\/a> The virus can spread from person to person.
