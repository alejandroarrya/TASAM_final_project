<p>No part of Syria is safe from violence.

The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The range of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited (to include accepting applications for U.S. passports and U.S. Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, as well as providing notarial services), and the U.S. government is unable to provide any emergency services to U.S. citizens in Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should try to quickly and safely leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country, if possible.</p>
<p>Long standing conflict with neighboring states and porous borders have contributed to a complex and unpredictable security environment. Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011.</p>
<p>The U.S. government particularly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including kidnapping by armed groups, arbitrary arrests, injury, or death. The U.S. government does not support this activity. Our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die in the conflict, is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaeda affiliates, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing risk of kidnapping and detentions of U.S. citizens and Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, with many abductions having occurred since mid-2012 and as recently as early 2019. U.S. citizens are also targets of arbitrary abduction and detention by the Syrian government and while in detention do not have access to due process or medical attention. Government detention centers are known to be unsanitary facilities where cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of detainees has been documented, as well as torture and extrajudicial killings. Note: Only the Syrian government can issue a valid entry visa to Syria. Failure to obtain a legitimate entry visa directly from the Syrian government could result in detention.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Syria, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/12/10/2018-26680/extension-of-the-prohibition-against-certain-flights-in-the-damascus-flight-information-region-fir"">Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR)</a>, which says that heightened military activity associated with the Syrian conflict may result in the risk of GPS interference, communications jamming, and errant long-range surface to air missiles straying into adjacent airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus Flight Information Region. These activities may inadvertently pose hazards to U.S. civil aviation transiting the region. It also has the potential to spill over into the adjacent airspace managed by neighboring states and eastern portions of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Syria, the FAA has not assessed the Government of Syria&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

<p>A novel (new) coronavirus officially known as COVID-19 is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness that began in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<a name=""_Hlk31362720""></a></p>
<p>The Hong Kong government has reported cases of the novel coronavirus in its special administrative region, has upgraded its response level to emergency, its highest response level, and is taking other steps to manage the novel coronavirus outbreak. On February 8, the Hong Kong government began enforcing a compulsory 14-day quarantine for anyone, regardless of nationality, arriving in Hong Kong who has visited mainland China within a 14-day period. This quarantine does not apply to individuals transiting Hong Kong International Airport and certain exempted groups such as flight crews. However, health screening measures are in place at all of Hong Kong&#8217;s borders and the Hong Kong authorities will quarantine individual travelers, including passengers transiting the Hong Kong International Airport, if the Hong Kong authorities determine the traveler to be a health risk. Please refer to the Hong Kong government&#8217;s <a href=""https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202002/07/P2020020700674.htm"">press release</a> for further details.</p>
<p>On January 30, the Hong Kong government closed certain transportation links and border checkpoints connecting Hong Kong with mainland China until further notice, and on February 3 suspended ferry services from Macau.</p>
<p>On February 10, 2020 the Department of State allowed for the voluntary departure of non-emergency U.S. Government employees and their family members due to the novel coronavirus and the effect to Mission personnel as schools and some public facilities have been closed until further notice.</p>
<p>On February 19, the <a href=""https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china"">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) issued a Level 1 Warning: Practice Usual Precautions in Hong Kong for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Department of State has raised the Travel Advisory for mainland China to Level 4: Do Not Travel due to the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The CDC has issued a Level 3 Warning for China: Avoid all nonessential travel.</p>
<p>At this time, CDC does&nbsp;not&nbsp;recommend canceling or postponing travel to Hong Kong. If you travel to Hong Kong, take the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid contact with sick people.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
<li>Clean your hands often by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at 60%&#8211;95% alcohol. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.<ul>
<li>It is especially important to clean hands after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you spent time in Hong Kong during the past 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek medical advice. Call ahead before going to a doctor&#8217;s office or emergency room. Tell them about your recent travel to Hong Kong, an area with community spread of coronavirus, and your symptoms.</li>
<li>Avoid contact with others.</li>
<li>Do not travel while sick.</li>
<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.</li>
<li>Clean your hands by washing them with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60%&#8211;95% alcohol immediately after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Soap and water should be used if hands are visibly dirty.</li>

<p><b>Country Summary:</b>&nbsp;Since June 2019, large scale and smaller political demonstrations have taken place in various areas of Hong Kong, including MTR stations, shopping malls, universities, and at Hong Kong International airport. While many demonstrations have been peaceful, some have resulted in violent confrontations between protesters and police &#8211; or between protesters and people who oppose the demonstrations &#8211; leading to serious injuries. Police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and water cannons.&nbsp;Some protesters have lit fires, built barricades, and thrown Molotov cocktails (petrol bombs). Police have identified and seized weapons and explosive materials linked to ongoing protest activity. Any protests that take place without a permit are considered illegal.</p>
<p>Protests, which can take place with little or no notice at any time of the week, are likely to continue and are often accompanied by vandalism and/or violence.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens, as well as U.S. Consulate General employees, have been subject to a People&#8217;s Republic of China propaganda campaign falsely accusing the United States of fomenting unrest in Hong Kong.</p>

<p><b>Country Summary: </b>Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>Armed conflict is ongoing and includes fighting between various political and ethnic groups. Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.</p>
<p>Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. Family members cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in South Sudan.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information U.S. citizens should consult&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/"">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices</a>.</p>

<p>As terrorist attacks, political violence (including demonstrations), criminal activities and other security incidents often take place without any warning, U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness when traveling abroad. When planning a trip and prior to departing the United States, U.S. citizens should consult country specific&nbsp;<a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html"">Travel Advisories</a>&nbsp;and information pages on&nbsp;<a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html"">travel.state.gov</a>.</p>

The Department uses these security messages to convey information about terrorist threats, security incidents, planned demonstrations, natural disasters, etc. In an emergency, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate or call the following numbers:&nbsp;<b>1 (888) 407-4747</b>&nbsp;(toll-free in the United States and Canada) or&nbsp;<b>1 (202) 501-4444</b>&nbsp;from other countries.</p>
<p>U.S. government facilities worldwide actively monitor potential security threats and may temporarily close or periodically suspend public services to assess their security posture.

U.S. citizens abroad are urged to monitor the local news and maintain contact with the nearest U.S. Embassy or consulate.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups including ISIS, al-Qa'ida, their associates, and those inspired by such organizations, are intent on attacking U.S. citizens wherever they are. Extremists may use conventional or non-conventional weapons to target U.S. government and private interests. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods, including edged weapons, pistols and vehicles, as weapons to effectively target crowds. Extremists increasingly aim to identify and attack &quot;soft&quot; targets, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)</li>
<li>hotels, clubs and restaurants</li>
<li>places of worship</li>
<li>schools</li>
<li>parks</li>
<li>shopping malls and markets</li>
<li>tourism infrastructure and tourist sites</li>
<li>public transportation systems</li>
<li>airports</li>
</ul>
<p>In multiple regions, terrorists, guerrilla groups and criminals seek to kidnap U.S. citizens to finance their operations or for political purposes. The Department also remains concerned that terrorists could again seek to down aircraft using concealed explosives or hijack commercial flights.</p>
<p>Private U.S. citizens should not travel to any country to participate in armed conflict. U.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of, or providing other forms of support to, designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a serious crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 12, 2018, the U.S. Department of State lifted the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel and family members. The U.S. Embassy in Managua is open to the public and provides the full range of consular services.</p>
<p>Throughout Nicaragua, armed and violent uniformed police or civilians in plain clothes acting as police (&#8220;para-police&#8221;) continue to target anyone considered to be in opposition to the rule of President Ortega. The government and its affiliated armed groups have been reported to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arbitrarily detain pro-democracy protestors, with credible claims of torture and disappearances.</li>
<li>Systematically target opposition figures, including clergy, human rights advocates, and members of the press.</li>
<li>Prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land.</li>
<li>Seize private property.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily search personal phones and computers for anti-government content.</li>
<li>Arbitrarily detain certain individuals with unfounded charges of terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime.</li>
</ul>
<p>These police and para-police groups often cover their faces, sometimes operate in groups numbering in the hundreds, and use unmarked vehicles.</p>
<p>Rallies and demonstrations in opposition to the rule of President Ortega have been declared unlawful, but nevertheless occur. Government forces, uniformed police, and para-police have attacked peaceful demonstrators leading to significant numbers of arrests, injuries, and deaths. Looting, vandalism, and arson often occur during unrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Road blocks, including in Managua and other major cities, may appear and limit availability of food and fuel.</p>
<p>Government hospitals are understaffed and may deny treatment to suspected protestors. Some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Ambulances have reportedly refused to respond or have been denied access to areas with individuals needing emergency care.</p>
<p>Violent crime, such as sexual assault and armed robbery, is common.</p>
<p>Civil unrest and poor infrastructure in parts of the country limit the Embassy&#8217;s ability to assist U.S. citizens in emergencies. U.S. government personnel must avoid demonstrations and require special permission to travel beyond a three-hour drive from Managua. Additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel may be put in place at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.</p>

<p>U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.</p>
<p>On December 31, 2019, the Embassy suspended public consular services, until further notice, as a result of damage done by Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the Embassy compound.&nbsp; U.S. Consulate General Erbil remains open and continues to provide consular services.&nbsp; On October 18, 2018, the Department of State ordered the suspension of operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Basrah.&nbsp; That institution has not reopened.&nbsp; Due to security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel in Baghdad have been instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to Syria to engage in armed conflict, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government stated that it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the border. Additionally, fighting on behalf of, or supporting designated terrorist organizations, is a crime that can result in penalties, including prison time and large fines in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Country Summary:</b> Violent crimes, such as grenade attacks and armed robbery, occur frequently. Though Westerners are unlikely to be targeted, the risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is high. Local police lack the resources and training to respond effectively to crimes.</p>
<p>Medical services in Burundi fall well below U.S. standards, and there are no adequate trauma services in the country. Emergency medical and fire services are limited or non-existent in some areas of the country. The CDC has also issued a <a href=""https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/malaria-burundi"">Level 1 Travel Notice on Malaria in Burundi</a>.</p>
<p>There are ongoing political tensions in Burundi, causing sporadic violence throughout the country. Police and military checkpoints are common and can restrict freedom of movement. Police have conducted weapon searches in the homes of private citizens. In the provinces of Cibitoke and Bubanza, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, as well as Mutimbuzi commune in Bujumbura Rural province, there have been armed attacks primarily conducted by groups operating from the eastern DRC. The border may close without notice.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens throughout Burundi. U.S. embassy personnel are subject to restrictions when traveling in certain areas of Burundi and may be subject to other constraints as security conditions warrant. These restrictions include limitations on travel outside of Bujumbura during hours of darkness (typically 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and prior approval for travel to the Bujumbura neighborhoods of Buyenzi, Bwiza, Cibitoke, Gasenyi, Kamenge, Kinama, Musaga, Mutakura, and Ngagara.</p>
<p>Due to travel restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel, the U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following areas: the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke, Kibira National Park (including the park&#8217;s southernmost part in Muramvya province), and Ruvubu and Buriri Forest. Embassy personnel are also prohibited from transiting through Kibira National Park to reach Kayanza via the RN-10.</p>

<p>Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and&nbsp;government facilities. Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks continue to happen across Pakistan, with most occurring in Balochistan and KPK, including the former FATA. Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s security environment has improved since 2014 when Pakistani security forces undertook concerted counter terrorist and counter militant operations. There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country. While threats still exist, terrorist attacks are rare in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security environment. Travel by U.S. government personnel within Pakistan is restricted, and additional restrictions on movements by U.S. government personnel outside of U.S. diplomatic facilities may occur at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions, which can change suddenly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar is unable to provide any consular services to U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Pakistan, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/"" adhocenable=""false"">Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices</a>.</p>

<p><b>Balochistan Province &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to Balochistan province. Active terrorist groups, an active separatist movement, sectarian conflicts, and deadly terrorist attacks against civilians, government offices, and security forces destabilize the province, including all major cities. In 2019, several bombings occurred in Balochistan province that resulted in injuries and deaths.</p>

<p><b>KPK Province, including the former FATA &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>Do not travel to KPK province, which includes the former FATA. Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government offices, and security forces. These groups historically have not discriminated between government officials and civilians. Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams.</p>

<p>Do not travel to the India-Pakistan border. Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. Indian and Pakistani military forces periodically exchange gunfire and artillery fire across the Line of Control (LoC). The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India. Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Areas Designated Off-Limits by the Mauritanian Military &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel</b></p>
<p>The government of Mauritania designates certain areas off-limits to foreigners and most Mauritanians. These &#8220;No Movement Zones&#8221; are extremely dangerous due to their proximity to Mali, where armed groups engaged in an active insurgency carry out cross-border attacks into Mauritania. The government of Mauritania does not maintain a substantial presence in these areas and thus police are unable to respond to most incidents there. In addition, cell phone coverage and paved roads are nonexistent. U.S. officials are unable to travel to these places. Since the boundaries of such areas frequently change, U.S. citizens should pay attention to all posted signs and notices of restricted entry. They should presume the following areas are off-limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>All areas north of the Tropic of Cancer</li>
<li>All areas east of 08&#8304; longitude (West of Greenwich) situated within 100km of the Mali Border</li>
